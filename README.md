Personal repo for my ECE539 project: implementing the MAML algorithm from Finn et al

To use the code in this file, you must download the Omniglot dataset, and trim each
language to have only 20/5 classes based on whether you're running 20 or 5 way classification.
The folders must be named as follows:
  - omniglot-processed-train
  - omniglot-processed-test
  - omniglot-processed-5-train
  - omniglot-processed-5-test
